If you agree to change Xfce theme to vanilla, your previous theme
will be saved into folder /home/dho/.config/xfce4.20220801-09:51:28

To restore the previous theme:
     - remove folder /home/dho/.config/xfce4
     - rename /home/dho/.config/xfce4.20220801-09:51:28 into /home/dho/.config/xfce4

(Note: this info is stored into file /home/dho/.config/EOS-xfce-theme.log).

Reboot is required for the theme change to take effect.

Accept theme change and reboot now?
